# 🎲 05_Probability_and_Statistics

## 📘 Overview

This folder explores **probability theory and statistical analysis** — essential foundations for data science and machine learning.
It includes notebooks and scripts demonstrating how to describe, summarize, and infer insights from data using statistical methods and probabilistic reasoning.

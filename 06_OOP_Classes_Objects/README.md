# 🧱 06_OOP_Classes_Objects

## 📘 Overview

This folder demonstrates Python's **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through examples and projects using classes and objects. It highlights how OOP helps organize code, improve reusability, and promote scalability for larger applications.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

The following tools and Python libraries are commonly used throughout this section:

* **Python** → Core programming language
* **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive analysis and code demonstration environment
* **VS Code / PyCharm** → IDEs for structured Python development

---

## 📊 Key Concepts Covered

* Class creation and object instantiation
* Constructors (`__init__`) and instance variables
* Inheritance and method overriding
* Encapsulation (private and protected attributes)
* Polymorphism and abstraction
* Real-world examples of applying OOP principles

---

## 🧪 Example Projects

* `class_basics.py` → Introduction to Python classes and objects
* `inheritance_examples.py` → Demonstrating parent-child relationships and method reuse
* `encapsulation_private.py` → Using private and protected attributes for data control
* `polymorphism_demo.py` → Implementing shared interfaces with different behaviors

---

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this section is to:

> Develop a practical understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming in Python**, enabling you to design, structure, and maintain scalable applications with clean and reusable code.

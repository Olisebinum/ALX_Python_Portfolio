## 🎓 Learning Outcome Summary

The **Integrated Project Series (P1 → P3)** represents a progressive, end-to-end data science workflow — from raw data acquisition to statistical validation and interpretation. Each stage refines your analytical thinking, coding efficiency, and understanding of real-world data handling.

---

### 🧩 **Part 1 – Data Collection & Preprocessing**

**Focus:** Building the foundation for reliable analysis.
You’ll gather data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, APIs), clean it, and prepare it for exploration.

**Key Python Skills:**

* Data importation and inspection (`pandas.read_csv`, `os`, `glob`)
* Handling missing data (`fillna`, `dropna`)
* Feature formatting and renaming
* Exporting cleaned data for analysis

**Main Scripts:**

* `data_cleaning.py` — reusable functions for handling missing values and inconsistent data types
* `data_merge.py` — combines multiple data files into a unified dataset

**Learning Outcome:**

> Develop the ability to collect, standardize, and preprocess messy, real-world datasets using Python automation.

---

### 🔍 **Part 2 – EDA and Data Validation**

**Focus:** Uncovering insights and relationships in your dataset through visual and statistical exploration.

**Key Python Skills:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
* Statistical summaries and correlation matrices
* Outlier detection and anomaly tracking
* Early-stage validation of dataset consistency

**Main Scripts:**

* `eda_summary.py` — generates descriptive statistics and summary plots
* `correlation_analysis.py` — identifies key relationships between numerical features

**Learning Outcome:**

> Strengthen your analytical thinking by interpreting visual patterns, trends, and distributions to identify hidden issues or biases within your data.

---

### 📊 **Part 3 – Validating Our Data**

**Focus:** Applying statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing to verify dataset integrity.

In this phase, you revisit earlier assumptions and apply **scientific validation** using hypothesis testing and variance analysis.
The goal is to determine whether your dataset is **representative of reality** — for instance, by comparing field data (`MD_agric_df`) against **weather station measurements**.

**Plan of Action:**

1. Formulate a **null hypothesis** to compare dataset means.
2. Clean and map both datasets.
3. Compute summary statistics and parameters for a **t-test**.
4. Interpret results to determine representativeness.

**Key Python Skills:**

* Statistical inference using `scipy.stats`
* Hypothesis testing (t-tests, variance comparison)
* Modular coding and reusability (importing preprocessing functions from P1)
* Writing clean, readable analysis notebooks

**Main Scripts:**

* `hypothesis_testing.py` — performs t-tests and interprets p-values
* `data_validation_pipeline.py` — orchestrates cleaning, mapping, and testing steps

**Learning Outcome:**

> Apply formal statistical methods to validate dataset reliability, using hypothesis testing to make evidence-based conclusions about data quality and representativeness.

### 🧠 **Integrated Learning Reflection**

Throughout these three projects, you evolve from **a data handler** to **a data scientist** — mastering how to:

* Design a complete data workflow from raw input to validated output
* Write modular, reusable Python scripts
* Apply statistical reasoning to real-world uncertainty
* Communicate insights through code and visualization

By the end of this series, you can confidently validate, interpret, and present your data-driven findings — the hallmark of a capable analyst and future data professional.
